# Rsa Keys

This folder contains the default generated RSA keys for Luna. The public key goes in your client configuration, and the private key stays in this folder.


# Generating New Keys

Changing the keys is <b>incredibly</b> important. If you don't, anyone downloading Luna will know your private key and will be able to sniff usernames and passwords when your players login. You can generate new keys using the RSAKeyGen tool.
