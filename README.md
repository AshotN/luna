- lightweight abstraction models that avoid [featuritis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_creep)  
- effective management of the host computer's resources 
- flexible, event-based Scala plugin system for game content
- highly documented code

# Contribute

Feel free to [submit an issue](https://github.com/lare96/luna/issues/new) if you're having issues, see any janky code, or if you just want to discuss something related to the project.

Alternatively, you can submit a [pull request](https://github.com/lare96/luna/pulls) to contribute code directly. When submitting pull requests though, please
- follow the current programming style present in the code (conventions, etc.)
- <b>do not</b> format the code as it makes it virtually impossible to see what your changes were
- look over the [plugins](https://github.com/lare96/luna/wiki/Scala-plugin-guide) section of the wiki if your PR contains Scala code, to see if your current code can be improved at all
