Thanks for taking the time out to contribute to the Luna project. Feel free to [submit an issue](https://github.com/lare96/luna/issues/new)
if you're having issues, see any janky code, or if you just want to discuss something related to the project.

Alternatively, you can submit a [pull request](https://github.com/lare96/luna/pulls) to contribute code directly. When submitting pull requests though, please
- follow the current programming style present in the code (conventions, etc.)
- <b>do not</b> format the code as it makes it very hard to see what your changes were
- look over the [conventions](https://github.com/lare96/luna/wiki/Writing-Plugins#conventions) section of the wiki if your PR contains
