# Please take great caution when modifying the contents of this TOML file, especially the "parent_dependency"
# key, which contains the name of the plugin that acts as the master dependency for all other plugins.

# Also please note that order for child dependencies is crucialâ€” if the child dependency order is modified, a child
# dependency that depends on another child dependency may fail to be evaluated correctly, resulting in a
# PluginEvaluationException.

# Last but not least, circular child dependencies are very unpredictable (meaning in one scenario they may fail, in another
# they may not) so their usage is highly discouraged.
