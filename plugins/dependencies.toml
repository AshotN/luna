# Please take great caution when modifying the contents of this TOML file, especially the "parent_dependency"
# key, which contains the name of the plugin that acts as the master dependency for all other plugins.

# Also note that order for child dependencies is crucialâ€” if the child dependency order is modified, a child
# dependency that depends on another child dependency may fail to be evaluated correctly, resulting in a
# PluginEvaluationException.

# Last but not least, please take into consideration writing the dependency code in Java before adding it
# here as lots of child dependencies is not ideal.
